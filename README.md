## Overview

The Movie Recommender System utilizes machine learning to provide personalized movie recommendations. The system is designed to suggest movies that align with user preferences based on historical data and a trained model. The frontend is implemented using the Streamlit library, which allows for an interactive and intuitive user experience.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations:** Get movie suggestions based on your input preferences.
- **Streamlit Interface:** Easy-to-use web interface for interacting with the recommender system.
- **Pre-trained Model:** Use a machine learning model that has been trained and saved for predictions.
- **Simple Setup:** Quick installation and setup process.

## Installation

To get started with the Movie Recommender System, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rjsandeepkumawat/movie_recommender.git
   cd movie_recommender
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Install the required libraries using the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
 **Additional Pickle file:**

   ```bash
   pickle.dump(similarity,open('similarity.pkl','wb'))
   ```
## Usage

To run the Movie Recommender System, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure you are in the project directory.**

2. **Run the Streamlit App:**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. **Open the App:**

   After running the command, Streamlit will provide a local URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8501`) where you can view and interact with the movie recommender system.

4. **Interact with the Interface:**

   Follow the instructions on the Streamlit interface to input your preferences and receive movie recommendations.

## Files

- **`app.py`**: The main script for running the Streamlit application. It contains the code for the frontend interface and the logic to interact with the recommender model.
- **`model.pkl`**: The serialized machine learning model used for making recommendations. This file should be in the same directory as `app.py` for the application to function correctly.
- **`requirements.txt`**: A file listing all the necessary Python packages required to run the application. It can be used with `pip` to install dependencies.
- **`similarity.pkl`**: This file should be in the same directory as `app.py` for the application to function correctly.
- **`app_background.jpg`**: This File is used for background in application you can choose your own by changing image path in app.py
